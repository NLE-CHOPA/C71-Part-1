<p> St. Xaviers is another of the nation’s, and the world’s, most excellent institutions of higher education, that maintains a speech and debate team that finished in the top ten in the nation in the past year. The campus regularly hosts tournaments on campus, giving the GPDT members exposure to other teams and events related to the club—a fabulous opportunity for networking. St. Xaviers is highly invested in enriching the experiences of their speech and debate students by providing as many resources and benefits as possible in their travel and competition, and team members are regularly recognized at National Debate Tournament championships as the best in that nation. </p>
